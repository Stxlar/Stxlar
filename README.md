## 🧬 About Me

I’m a self-driven learner obsessed with reverse engineering, web exploitation, and all the weird corners of the internet that people don’t understand… yet.

Right now I’m focused on:

- 🧠 Building a solid cybersecurity skillset from the ground up
- 💣 Solving CTFs (Capture The Flag) to master real-world hacking techniques
- ⚙️ Pushing code, documenting my learning, and sharpening tools daily
- 🛠️ Creating writeups, notes, and walkthroughs that help *me* first — and others second

## 💡 Current Challenge: 100 CTFs in 31 Days

I’m solving **100 Capture The Flag challenges by the end of July 2025**.

- ✅ PicoCTF challenges
- ✅ HTB
- 🔜 More from pwnable.kr, overthewire, etc.
- 📚 All documented in [my CTF writeups repo](https://github.com/Stxlar/CTF_Writeups)

I mostly work with:
- 🐚 Bash for automation and CLI-fu
- 🐍 Python for scripting, CTF tooling, and learning exploit writing
- ⚙️ C for binary-level understanding
- 💥 Assembly (x86/x64) for reverse engineering and pwn

## 📚 Ongoing Projects

- [`ctf-writeups`](https://github.com/Stxlar/CTF_Writeups) – Daily CTF grind, medium/hard walkthroughs
- `payload-sandbox` – My personal toolbox for crafting and testing exploits (coming soon)

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Understand the why. Not just the how.”

I don’t just want flags — I want to understand the systems I’m breaking, down to the byte.
